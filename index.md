## About Me
I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I am interested in statistical research for modern molecular epidemiology surveys, specially with [emerging study designs and assay technologies](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1359-z). Such "omics" data types pose many exciting challenges and opportunities for statistical method development. See examples in [studies of the microbiome](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008913), [cancer transcriptional subtyping](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1511-4), and [cell-cell interaction inferenced from spatial proteomics](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(21)03480-6/fulltext?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F).

Previously, I got my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, advised by Professor [Curtis Huttenhower](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/). I also completed a short postdoc with Professors Huttenhower and [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/) (Harvard Statistics), as well as full postdoctoral training at the University of Pennsylvania, under the supervision of Professor [Hongzhe Li](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/).
